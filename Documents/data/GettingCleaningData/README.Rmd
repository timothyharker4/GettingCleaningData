# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
This is for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The run_analysis.R script works as follows:

1. Loads all necessary files from the dataset while working direction contains the UCI HAR Dataset folder
2. Combines the testing and training data for the subject data, measurement (X) data, and activity (Y) data
	and properly names the variables in each data set
3. Replaces the numbers in the activity data with the appropriate activity name
4. Merges the subject, activity, and desired measurement data in to one data frame
5. Cleans up remaining variable names
6. Creates a tidy data set containing the mean of each variable for each combination of subject and activity

The final data set in saved in a file called tidy.txt
